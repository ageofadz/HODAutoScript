# HODAutoScript
Script for grabbing historical data from ToS. Uses [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) to simulate mouseclicks and keying in date information. Geared towards getting historical option data in CSV format for quantitative analysis.

# Use:

Navigate to the option chain view on ThinkorSwim and use OnDemand. Set the date to your start date manually, and save a test return to the folder you want to save the data to.

Currently works on Linux only. [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) is required for this utility. Tested on Debian 10.7.0.

# Contributing:

Format code with single tab spacing and write clear pull requests.
